Safety Guidelines
-----------------

Everyone in the lab is responsible for following all health and safety
regulations of [WWU Environmental Health and Safety](https://ehs.wwu.edu/).

# PPE

Backpacks and jackets should be hung up on the provided hooks, to avoid tripping
hazards.

Closed toed shoes are required. Long hair is recommended to be tied back, and is
required to be tied back if you are working with any hardware (robots or
prototyping station).

# Food and Drink

Drinks in closed containers (i.e. waterbottles, cups with lids and straws) are allowed.
However, they should not be placed on a table with hardware.

Food in lab is discouraged but ok if consumed at a table away from hardware, and
is cleaned up properly.

# Waste Disposal

Most materials in the lab can be disposed of in the trash cans outside the lab.

Anything with a Hazmat symbol should not go in the trash, especially batteries. If you're
not sure, ask Professor Nilles.

## Batteries and e-Waste

All batteries should be disposed of in the bucket inside the fume hood.

All other e-waste (wires, circuit boards, etc) should be placed in the disposal
box next to the fume hood.

We will periodically request hazardous waste pickups from the university.

# First Aid

In the event of large amounts of blood, loss of consciousness, or other
severe injury, call emergency services via 911, then contact Professor Nilles.

For less severe injuries (messy paper cut, etc.) there is a first aid kit
mounted to the wall in the lab. If you use the kit, send Prof. Nilles a note so
I can keep track of supplies.

# Electrical Hazards

The electrical cables hanging from the ceiling are live and can potentially
deliver a larger shock than a traditional wall outlet. Do not use these cables
unless specifically instructed.

# Burn Hazards

In addition to electrical sources, the protoyping station also presents burn risks. Both the soldering station and the 3D printer become very hot and should not be touched with bare hands if they have been recently used.

The laser cutter presents the largest burn risk. Use only with permission from Prof. Nilles and while supervised by at least one professor or graduate student. Only approved materials may be used with the laser cutter.

If any Lithium batteries begin to swell, place them into the bucket in the fume
hood and notify Professor Nilles. If a lithium battery is damaged or punctured,
dispose of it in the same way. If a lithium battery catches fire, exit the lab
immediately and call 911; you do not want to breathe the smoke. We will also
have an annual fire safety and evacuation protocol training.

The nearest fire extinguisher is.... somewhere.

# Chemical Hazards

There are very few chemical hazards in the lab. If we are working with soft
robotics, we may be curing silicone or similar materials. These may offgass some
volatile organic compounds and should be placed inside the fume hood, with the
fume hood turned on while curing.

Do not eat anything you find in the lab.

# Robot Hazards

## UR3e Universal Robots Arms

While this robot arm has safety features, they are not foolproof. Always tie back long hair when working with the robot arms, and keep an awareness of where the robot is.

Most injuries due to robot arms are to the fingers or head.

The maximum speed of the arm is 1 meter/second and the maximum payload is 3kg. These limits cannot be exceeded.

If the robot arm were to throw an object with maximum payload at maximum speed,
it would have the same momentum as a baseball going 45 miles per hour.

No using the robot arms without explicit permission and supervision from at
least one professor or graduate student.

See [Getting Started with UR3e Arms](arms.md) for more info.

### Conveyor Belts

There are also two adjustable-speed conveyor belts meant for use with the robot
arms. Do not use these without supervision and be sure to secure all loose hair
and clothing first. Do not modify the conveyor belts. Do not sit or stand on the
conveyor belts. When adjusting the height of the conveyor belts, be very careful
when loosening bolts as the top surface may suddenly fall.


## iRobot Creates

These robots are modelled after the Roomba product (also from iRobot) and are probably the safest robots we have.

However, injury is still possible, mostly through tripping hazards. Be sure to store the Creates in their "cave" under the desks in the corner when you are done using them.

See [Getting started with iRobot Creates](creates.md) for more info.

## CrazyFlies

These tiny quadcopters are meant to only be flown inside, and in particular, inside the drone safety cage.

Even though they are tiny, their propellers spin very fast and could cause injury to eyes or other fragile parts in a collision with a human.

See [Getting Started with CrazyFlies](flies.md) for more info.

## Bigger Drones

The larger drones are both more expensive and easier to break than the CrazyFlie drones.

DJI drones are not approved for indoor use, and the Elios 3 can only be piloted by someone who has completed the pilot training.

To fly any drone or UAV outside, you must have an FCC remote pilot's license, AND permission from Prof. Nilles.

Safety Guidelines
-----------------

Everyone in the lab is responsible for following all health and safety
regulations of [WWU Environmental Health and Safety](https://ehs.wwu.edu/).

# PPE

Backpacks and jackets should be hung up on the provided hooks, to avoid tripping
hazards.

Closed toed shoes are required. Long hair is recommended to be tied back, and is
required to be tied back if you are working with any hardware (robots or
prototyping station).

# Food and Drink

Drinks in closed containers (i.e. waterbottles, cups with lids and straws) are allowed.
However, they should not be placed on a table with hardware.

Food in lab is discouraged but ok if consumed at a table away from hardware, and
is cleaned up properly.

# Electrical Hazards

The electrical cables hanging from the ceiling are live and can potentially
deliver a larger shock than a traditional wall outlet. Do not use these cables
unless specifically instructed.

# Robot Hazards

## UR3e Universal Robots Arms

## CrazyFlies

## Bigger Drones

## iRobot Creates

# Waste Disposal

## Batteries

# Fire Safety

# First Aid

In the event of large amounts of blood, loss of consciousness, or other
severe injury, call emergency services via 911, then contact Professor Nilles.

For less severe injuries (messy paper cut, etc.) there is a first aid kit
mounted to the wall in the lab. If you use the kit, send Prof. Nilles a note so
I can keep track of supplies.
